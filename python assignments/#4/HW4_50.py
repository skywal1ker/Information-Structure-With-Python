"""
50. Develop a Python program that will: (1) prompt for input, (2) extract all the vowels
in the input string and make them lowercase, (3) add all the nonduplicate vowels you
found into a temporary string, and (4) stop the code when you have collected all five
vowels (aeiou) and print the number of trials that you did to collect all five vowel
characters.
