"""
In this assignment you will implement string representation for files. 
you will write editor functions to move the “cursor”. In each representation, you use a cursor to represent the current position. The cursor is just the position (index). Write (and test) the following  10 functions (names are taken from old vi editor) for each implementation
(1)	cmd_h: move cursor one character to the left 
(2)	cmd_I: move cursor one character to the right
(3)	cmd_j: move cursor vertically up one line 
(4)	cmd_k: move cursor vertically down one line
(5)	cmd_X: delete the character to the left of the cursor
(6)	cmd_D: remove on current line from cursor to the end
(7)	cmd_dd: delete current line and move cursor to the beginning of next line
(8)	cmd_ddp: transpose two adjacent lines
(9)	cmd_n:  search for next occurrence of a string (assume that string to be searched is fully in one line.
(10)	cmd_wq: write your representation as text file and save it
Think of and implement any other 10 (interesting!!!) editor commands (your choice)
You can look at some of vi ditor commands for suggestions
