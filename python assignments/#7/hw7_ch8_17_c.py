"""
17. Remove Odds or Evens:
(a) Write a function that takes a list of integers as an argument, removes even numbers
from the list, and returns the modified list.
(b) Write a function that takes a list of integers as an argument, removes odd numbers
from the list, and returns the modified list.
(c) Write a function that takes a list of integers and a Boolean as arguments. If the
Boolean is True the function removes odd numbers from the list; otherwise, evens
are removed. The function returns the modified list.
