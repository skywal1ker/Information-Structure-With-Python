10. A nursery rhyme: As I was going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven wives. Every wife had seven
sacks, and every sack had seven cats, every cat had seven kittens. Kittens, cats, sacks, and wives, how
many were going to St. Ives? There are interesting aspects to this puzzle, such as who is
actually going to St. Ives. For our purposes, assume that everyone and everything are
headed to St. Ives. Write a program to calculate that total.
"""


man = 1
wives = 7
sacks = 7
cats = 7
kittens = 7

total = man * wives * sacks * cats * kittens
print("My answear will be:", total)
