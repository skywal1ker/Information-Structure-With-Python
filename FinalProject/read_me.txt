MET CS-521 Information Structures With Python

READ ME:

	Make sure that the datetime module and os module works on your version of Python
	To run the code, click on the "Final_Python_Project.py" file. 

	
	"If you want to start app, do 'start', if you want to exit, do 'done' "
	for example ---------------------------------------
	Enter your device type: 'phone'
	Enter your brand: apple 
	Enter your model: iphone11
	Enter your serial number:123456 (here you can type any number)
	 --------------------------------------------------
	If you don't know command that allowed you can type 'help', here program shows the supported commands.

	If you want to check your discharge files, click on the discharge_files folder and find the .txt file. The 
	program should tell you where to find it as well.

	DO NOT DELETE the "Discharge_Files" folder, otherwise an error will occur (it won't terminate the program
	but there won't be output files). If there is no "Discharge_Files" folder, make the folder in the same directory 
	as "Final_Python_Project.py". It's case sensitive, so name the folder exactly (without the quotes, of course).
